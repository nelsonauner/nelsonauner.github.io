1. Good teams focus on delivering impact

2. Measuring true impact is hard because the end behavior change (impact) can be weeks/months from feature usage

3. Instead of giving up, or spending millions on hiring fancy statisticians (I do consulting!), you should err on proxy metrics that gave quick feedback, but finding a good proxy metric is very hard. (Again, I do consulting)

"Getting a team to rally behind a problem is incredibly empowering, because it unblocks much more creative approaches to a solution, and makes it much more likely those solutions will actually work."
