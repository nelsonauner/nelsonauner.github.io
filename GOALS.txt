- TO DO 
- can we not display an image if the image file is blank? 
- turn all old site into posts, with categories
- have category pages display relevant posts
- on main page: full info for most recent 5 posts, then abbreviated - (subtitle)
- 

2 data types:

Long post - seperate page
  - this post has several attributes: 
     - date
	 - title
	 - subtitle - short content to be displayed on main page. 
	 - picture - a small pic to be displayed on the main page. Every post must have one? 
	 - url of the post page. 
	 #Kao's posts have a *category* variable. maybe you can use an if statement to only show posts of the relevant category. 
	 
	 
	 categories:
	 -tech
	 -research
	 -travels
	 -food
