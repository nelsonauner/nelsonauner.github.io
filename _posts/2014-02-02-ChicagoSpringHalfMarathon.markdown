I've signed up to run my second Chicago Spring Half Marathon. 
I ran it last year with a group from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/159591867498067/">UChicago Road Runner</a>.
The race is a ton of fun, and I'm trying to beat my previous time.<a href="http://www.chicagospringhalf.com/"> Sign up here </a> $70, (includes a great brunch, very good support stations) and come run with us!
