Over a long a weekend, a friend and I traveled to Pucon, a popular tourist destination. 
It was a great trip, and I really recommend it to anyone who goes to Chile. [Link to Trip Advisor] (http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g294297-Pucon_Araucania_Region-Vacations.html)

We mainly used the lonely planet guide book, to structure the trip, with the following itinerary:

Day 0: 
	-Leave Santiago and take overnight bus to Pucon. We got dropped off at 4am in a terminal in a different city, we hung around and asked each bus si 'va a Pucon'! It was stressful but everything worked out OK.
Day 1:
	-We arrived in Pucon early in the morning and  walked around on a path near the lake. 
	-Checked into ecole, a hostel. I was happy with the accomodations 
	-Reserved a next day trip up Volcano Villaricca
	-Checked out bikes and rode all the way to Lago Caburga
	-Very tired, rode back, ate dinner at the supermarket and collapsed


Day 2:
	-Woke up early and embarked on our tour up Villarica. Still one of the best experience os of my life. After a car ride to the base of the mountain, and a short explanation of gear (ice pick included!) we started the ascent. The volcano is very steep, so we went up doing switchbacks. It took about 6 hours to reach the top, afterwhich one of our companions revealed that he had carried a 6-pack of beer!

-The most incredible part was the descent. We took out plastic trays that we had carried up, and slid down the mountain. It was very fast.

-By the time we finished the descent, it was getting dark. We had some bread for dinner, walked around town, and called it a day.


Day 3: 
	- Again, we woke up early and took a local bus to huerquehue parque nacional [Google images] (https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=huerquehue+parque+nacional&hl=en&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=Q79VU738JdKfyATGnYLYCQ&sqi=2&ved=0CCQQsAQ&biw=1364&bih=664), a beautiful national park on the outskirts of town. We spent the day there, headed back, grabbed dinner, and jumped on the bus back to Santiago!
