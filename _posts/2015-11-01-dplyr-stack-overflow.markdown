I joined stack overflows and answered a couple of `dplyr`-related questions. 
My favorite one involved twisting `eval(parse())` to apply generic ANOVA's to
grouped data. 


1. [Connect to database with stored credentials in dplyr](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33616121/connect-to-mysql-database-via-dplyr-using-stored-credentials/33665341#33665341)

2. (my favorite) [Apply anova over subsets of data](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32442525/r-function-to-apply-anova-over-different-subsets-of-ones-dataset-and-collect-o/33834314#33834314) 

3. [Connect to an external server's database] (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26806734/connecting-to-an-external-server-database-using-dplyr/33088253#33088253)


If you're a SO (or dplyr) veteran, let me know what I can do better!
