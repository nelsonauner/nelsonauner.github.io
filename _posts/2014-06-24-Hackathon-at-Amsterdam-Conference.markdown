I had the opportunity to attend this year's Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC) conference, at the University of Amsterdam. 

OSDC is a cloud hosting organization for open science (duh) 
They provide academic researchers with a secure, dedicated compute cloud and have interesting projects in biology and geospatial analysis. They also push for reproducible research in academia, which is a critical need. (link to picketty) 

The conference ended with a casual hackathon contest, judged by professors and post-docs from several universities. 

My partner and I, Cody Buntain, won 1st place for *Mayfly* a series of bash scripts that installs dropbox on a computer and uploads the contents of a directory to a custom folder and then returning a public-viewing link.

We hope to make it easier for people to begin reproducible research by making it dead-simple to share your code and output with collaberators. Surely, I thought, there must be a middle ground between emailing out large code files (which some professors do) and learning knitr (which most professors don't). With *Mayfly*, the dropbox folder always contains the most up-to-date code. For programs like knitr, dropbox's ability to view html files online means that results are viewable without downloading anything!

Knitr and git and all of these "cutting edge" (at least in academia) tools are great, but what's the point if only 5% of professors use them? Expanding the use of reproducible research is perhaps more important than increasing its sophistication.
