##Directions##

Starting from the Instituto Cultural Oaxaca, head North up the main road, and then turn west towards the hill with the white cross and antennas. You will reach a hospital. Keep ascending on the road to the right until you reach the path that goes up the hill. 
Near the Antennas at the very top (around mile 1 on the map), a second path shoots off to the right.  Take it and it will join up with a road, which you follow straight (towards the mountains in the distance), until you find a little path. Don't be afraid to ask people the route to the "carreterra", or abondaned highway. 
I was approached by angry dogs at this point. Brandish a stick! 

Once you're on the highway (mile 3) , it's easy going! Enjoy the beautiful three miles on the abandoned highway before heading back south.
