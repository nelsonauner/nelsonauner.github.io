I'm very honored to have been awarded first place in UChicago's Data Visualization Challenge for "Making Indonesia",  a website with a series of graphs and an interactive visualization exploring Indonesia's manufacturing sector. You can explore the website here [](nelsonauner.com/dviz). 

My favorite entry of the competition was Kevin Wang's [Can I graduate](canigraduate.uchicago.edu).
