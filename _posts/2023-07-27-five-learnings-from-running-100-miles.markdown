I recently ran my first 100 mile trail run in a little over 29 and a half hours. 

Needless to say, I had a lot of time to think, and came up with five observations on strategy:

# 1. Plan the work, then work the plan 

The most important part of my run was on the week before, when I planned out my plan and detailed hourly nutrition plan. 
I did this via a five page document written in complete sentences - I am huge believer in amazon-style written documents as a way to organize thoughts and evaluate decisions. I broke my nutrition plan down into hourly intake of water, salt, and carbs. 

One detail that worked great was what I call "Pick two": Every hour, I had to drink 500mL of Gu Roctane and then two of either Gu Gel, Gu Chews, or a solid food like a sandwhich. This worked well because it forced me to even out my caloric intake - if I was hungry for solid food, I could have two sandwhiches, but if I wasn't, I could have a Gu Gel and Gu Chew. 



# 2. Have a light-weight tracking system

You want some system for tracking progress, but that system cannot distract you from actually accomplishing your goals! I have seem teams sabotage themselves by optimizing their work to their tracking system, instead of the other way around. My light-weight tracking system was:

1. Every aid station, a volunteer would fill out my nutrition plan to variance worksheet: Track actual consumption vs. planned and alert if off
2. At each aid station, my 500mL bottle should be empty 

For a great example of an "actual to plan" tracking system for engineering teams, check out this blog: [Agile Planning Part 3 â€” Monitoring and Optimizing](https://bobwilkinson20.medium.com/agile-planning-part-3-monitoring-and-optimizing-e276be036673)

# 3. Break down insane goals into attainable subgoals, and celebrate them!

If you're trying to motivate yourself, or your team, for a goal that feels so big it's out of sight, break it down into highly visible shorter goals

Instead of thinking of the race as a 100 mile run, I thought of it as a 30 mile run, followed by another 30 mile run, and then a 40 mile run. I didn't start my watch until mile 60, because then I could tell myself that I only had to run 40 miles. 

The, to get excited about the first two 30 mile sections, I built myself different menus so that I could look forward to trying new food:

- The first 30 miles was Turkey Sandwiches, Hibiscus Gu Roctane, and fruity Gu Gels
- The second 30 miles, I got to have my night blend of Gu with my favorite flavors, try a new Gu Roctane Flavor (Summit Tea), and have pudding for dessert.
- Then, I started my watch, and enjoyed Coca-Cola and my wake-up Gu Gel blend until the finish line.


# 4. Positive Energy is contagious

During the night section, I was joined by a friend who brough a super positive cheery attitude (and music playlist to match!). It's really incredible how much better things are with positive people, and it's something I need to work on: "When in doubt, err on being someone who is pleasant to be around"!

# 5. Ultras aren't life: Sometimes it's better to work in sprints

Sometimes during the race, I would feel fantastic, and start to pick up my pace. Sometimes, I would feel tired, and start to slow down. In both situations, I would make a conscious effort to moderate my pace back towards my target heart rate. However, in real life, there are times when a sprinting and resting method make sense. In some sense, I believe that running 100 miles is a lot better analogy to being a manager - staying positive, monitoring progress, setting goals - than it is being an actual creative or maker. Endurance running is not a creative endeavor, so there is no benefit to pushing oneself beyond a long-term sustainable effort.
