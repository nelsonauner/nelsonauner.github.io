<p>- Using a Virtual Private Network as a UChicago student</p>
<p><a href="https://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/vpn-cvpn" > UChicago's VPN (Cisco Anyconnect) </a> <br/> <p><b>What is a virtual private network? </b></p>
<p>Basically, when you use a VPN (virtual private network), your computer first connects to Uchicago computers. Then, Uchicago computers access the webpage you want and send it to your computer. For the websites you access, it appears as if you are a computer at UChicago. This way, you can access content only available in the US (hulu, Pandora, facebook in China, etc). It also improves security and protects your identity by not revealing your location and IP address. </p>
