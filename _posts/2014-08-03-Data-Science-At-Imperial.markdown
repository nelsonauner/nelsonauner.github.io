I'll be spending August at the Data Science institute of Imperial College, London.
They have collaberative corporate relationships with companies like [Huawei](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/data-science/research/innovation-lab) and [KPMG](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_15-7-2014-10-29-9). 
I'm not sure if Universities in the US are as adept and collaberating with the private sector (for better or for worse, I don't know). 
I'll be working on an interactive visualization for the [Supercomputing conference](http://sc14.supercomputing.org/) this November.
