A paper I co-wrote with a classmate on Chicago's controversial (and expensive) Violence Reduction Initiative has been published in the [Nottingham Economic Review](http://neronline.co.uk/), 
an undergraduate journal based at the University of Nottingham. You can read the publication [here](http://issuu.com/nottinghameconomicreview/docs/ner_final_magazine_25.02web__2_)			
	
	
	
You can read the [press release from the Chicago Mayor's office](http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2012/august_2012/mayor_emanuel_usdepartmentofjusticeandchicagopolicedepartmentexp.html)
 that served as a motivation for the paper. 				
 
 
 
I'd like to thank Prof. Tony Cookson, Prof. Ali Hortaçsu, Prof. Michael Stein, and Nathan Hess from the UChicago Crime Lab for their help and feedback.
