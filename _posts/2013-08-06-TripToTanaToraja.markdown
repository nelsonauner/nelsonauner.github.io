During the month of Ramadan, a friend and I decided to hike through parts of Tana Toraja, a popular wilderness destination in Sulaweisi, one of the large islands of Indonesia.   

Basic Logistics: From Jakarta to Rantepao: 

I booked plane tickets from Jakarta to Makassar, and spent a day in Makassar visiting Fort Rotterdam and the nearby beach.From Makassar, we took the overnight Binta Prima, the "high-end" bus ("high end" means fantabulous designs??). The roads are quite bumpy, so don't expect to get any sleep! 
Make sure to pack: 		
-  Sunscreen	
-  Bug spray	
-  Good hiking clothes	
-  Indonesian Rupiah	
-  Hats & Sunglasses	
-  A high quality travel map of the area 	
-  A phone with GPS and a pre-loaded google map of the area 	
-  Basic Indonesian dictionary		

From Rantepao through Batutomonga:
The bus drops you off early in the morning in Rantepao, and I immediately begin hiking northwards on an ambitous trek. We had decided earlier to go without a guide, which is not the norm in Indonesian tourism. We quicky hiked northwards towards batutomonga, stopping for lunch at a touristy cafe on the slopes. The scenary was drop-dead gorgeous. We then walked west along the main road into the mountains...(more to come)
