> Prospect theory contains four main elements. First, individuals derive utility not from
> wealth (or consumption) levels, but rather from gains and losses relative to some
> reference point.7 Second, individuals are more sensitive to losses than to gains, i.e., they
> exhibit loss aversion. The utility function captures the loss aversion of individuals in a
> kink at the reference point, with the function being steeper in the losses region
> compared to the gains region. Third, individuals exhibit diminishing sensitivity to gains
> and losses, i.e., moving from a $100 to a $200 gain (or loss) has a larger utility impact
> than moving from a $10,100 to a $10,200 gain (or loss). Fourth, the theory incorporates
> probability weighting: individuals weigh outcomes by subjective, transformed
> probabilities or decision weights, overweighting low probabilities and underweighting
> high probabilities.
