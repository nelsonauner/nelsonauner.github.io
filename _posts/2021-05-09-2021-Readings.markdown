_I'll continue to add books here throughout the year_

1. _Principles of Corporate Finance (Richard A. Brealey, Stewart C. Myers, Franklin Allen)_ This tome was much more engaging and humorous than I anticipated (an admittedly low bar). I have a much better sense for questions like "What does cost of capital mean?" or "When is adding debt to a company useful?". 

2. _Inside Job: The Looting of America's Savings and Loans_. Investigative reporting and detailed drama make this read like a John Grisham legal thriller.

3. [Law School for Everyone - The great courses](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/law-school-for-everyone)
