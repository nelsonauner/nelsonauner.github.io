				<p>A collection of tips to improve productivity, etc, mostly focused on UChicago students</p>
			    
</p>
<p><b> 1) Using a Virtual Private Network as a UChicago student</b></p>
<p><a href="https://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/vpn-cvpn" > UChicago's VPN (Cisco Anyconnect) </a> <br/> <b>What is a virtual private network? </b> Basically, when you use a VPN (virtual private network), your computer first connects to Uchicago computers. Then, Uchicago computers access the webpage you want and send it to your computer. For the websites you access, it appears as if you are a computer at UChicago. This way, you can access content only available in the US (hulu, Pandora, facebook in China, etc). It also improves security and protects your identity by not revealing your location and IP address. </p>
<p><b> How to access UChicago's VPN?</b></br> </p>
<p><ul>
<li> Download the client free at <a href="https://itservices.uchicago.edu/services/vpn-cvpn" > UChicago's VPN (Cisco Anyconnect) </a> </li>
<li> Install the client on your computer </li>
<li> Open the client (called cisco Anyconnect VPN client) on your computer and enter your credentials (cnet ID and password) </li>
<li> Voila! Access your favorite sites as if you were in Chicago. Let me know if you have problems </li> 
</ul>

<p><b> 2) Microsoft One Note </b></p>
<p> Not much to say about this. One note is the perfect windows software for note-taking, to-do lists, or just sketching. Automatically syncs with Skydrive, to work across multiple devices.</p>
<p> See <a href = "http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/"> the official site </a> and blogs for tons of awesome advice  </p>
<p><b> 3) Programming </b></p>
<p> 
 See the resources section of the main "home" page for my preferred sources of python and R knowledge.</br>
 For a great guide of using virtual environments, heroku and django, see <a href = "https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django"> Django/Heroku guide </a> and <a href= "http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/"> Windows Setup Guide </a> </br>
 My preferred (Windows) Partition Editor: <a href:"http://www.partitionwizard.com/"> Partition Wizard </a> </br>
